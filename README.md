# Concrete_strength_ml_GC_task
Concrete compressive strength prediction, EDA + Linear Regression

# Dataset
Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset (UCI)

# Work Done
- Data cleaning
- Duplicate removal
- Train/Val/Test split
- EDA with histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps
- Linear Regression (sklearn)
- Linear Regression (from scratch)
- R2 score calculation

# Key Insights from EDA
- Most features are right-skewed
- Cement and Age show strongest positive correlation with strength
- Water shows negative correlation
- Fine aggregate is closest to normal distribution

# Key insights from model training
- R2 score closely matches for both linear regression models
